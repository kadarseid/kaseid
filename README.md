- 👋 Hi, I’m Kadar, an aspiring junior software developer based in Hargeisa, Somalia. 
- 👀 lthough I didn’t attend CS college, I’ve always been passionate about technology and coding. To pursue my career in tech, I took a proactive approach and used Dugsiiye Mentorship Program to learn programming and also took a ton of programming courses to enhance my programming knowledge.
- 🌱 I started with foundational courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m currently learning React; 
- 💞️ I’m currently seeking an entry-level position where I can apply my skills and continue to grow as a developer. I’m particularly excited about joining a dynamic team that values continuous learning and innovation.
